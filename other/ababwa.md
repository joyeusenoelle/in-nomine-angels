# ABABWA

You are residents of a wealthy kingdom in the desert. Months ago, your Prince led a delegation to a nearby kingdom to woo its ruler's daughter, a reclusive princess. He never returned and the entire delegation has vanished. It's up to you to figure out what happened to him!

## SKILLS AND ROLLS

You have two skills: Strength and Spirit. Use Strength when you're using force or being tough; use Spirit when you're being quick or smart. When you use a skill, roll as many 6-sided dice as you have points in that skill. If any dice come up 5 or 6, you succeed; otherwise you fail. Always roll at least 1 die, even if a penalty would drop you below 1 in a skill.

## DISFAVOR

Your gods like people who succeed. Start with 0 Disfavor; any time you fail a roll, add 1 to your total. When your total reaches 6, the gods frown on you: you might attract bandits, be grievously wounded, trip an unseen trap, and so on. If you survive, roll 1d6 and subtract the result from your Disfavor total.

## TYPES

Choose or roll for your character type. You can make your own if you like; in general, your character's Strength and Spirit should add up to 6.

|  | Type | Strength | Spirit | Advantage |
| --- | ----- | --------- | --------- | ---------------------- |
| 1 | Sorcerer | 1 | 5 | You can roll Spirit to see long distances and conjure items, but suffer 2 Disfavor if you fail |
| 2 | Scholar | 2 | 4 | +1d6 on any roll to know and remember things, but you're hopeless in combat |
| 3 | Spy | 3 | 3 | +1d6 to find and disarm traps, but nobody trusts you |
| 4 | Adventurer | 3 | 3 | Add 1 point of Disfavor to gain +1d6 to any roll |
| 5 | Hunter | 4 | 2 | +1d6 to track or find anything, but you have trouble interacting with other humans |
| 6 | Guard | 5 | 1 | +1d6 to attack or defend, but you're clumsy outside of combat |
