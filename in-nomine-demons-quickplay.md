# In Nomine: Infernal

You're a group of demons, sent to earth in human guise to corrupt and pervert humans. The forces of Heaven aren't your only adversaries; ethereal spirits, human sorcerers, and divine Saints also vie for the souls of humanity.

## SKILLS AND ROLLS

You have two skills: Corporeal and Celestial. Use Corporeal for physical activities and to interact with humans; use Celestial for mental and spiritual activities. When you use a skill, roll as many 6-sided dice as you have points in that skill. If any dice come up 6, you succeed; otherwise you fail. Always roll at least 1 die, even if a penalty would drop you below 1 in a skill.

Roll 1d6 to determine your demonic band, or pick one from the list. Each band gains a bonus in certain situations, but their infernal nature hinders them in others. You can design your own, but each band's Corporeal and Celestial should total to 6, they should get +1d to some activity, and they should be prohibited from doing something.

|  | Choir | Corporeal | Celestial | Advantage/Disadvantage |
| --- | ----- | --------- | --------- | ---------------------- |
| 1 | Balseraph | 1 | 5 | +1d6 to convince someone you're telling the truth; can't get caught in a lie |
| 2 | Habbalite | 3 | 3 | +1d6 to change someone's emotional state; can't let emotions sway decisions |
| 3 | Calabite | 3 | 3 | +1d6 to wreak havoc; can't go too long without causing damage |
| 4 | Djinn | 2 | 4 | +1d6 to track someone or something; can't get attached to anything |
| 5 | Lilim | 4 | 2 | +1d6 to convince someone to do something; can't break the exact wording of a promise |
| 6 | Impudite | 5 | 1 | +1d6 to convince someone to do something bad; can't kill humans |

## VESSEL

Every demon has a vessel, an earthly body that allows them to interact with the corporeal world. If you fail a Corporeal roll, your vessel takes 1 damage. When your vessel reaches 6 damage, it dies, and you must wait for your Demon Prince to give you a new one. The GM will tell you when you can re-enter the game.

## DISSONANCE

Any time you do something your band can't do, add 1 to your Dissonance and roll 1d6. If your roll is greater than or equal to your Dissonance, you're fine for now. If it's under your Dissonance, you gain a Discord from the following table and reset your Dissonance to 0.

|  | Discord | Description |
| --- | ------- | ----------- |
| 1 | Vestigium | Your body gains an unnatural feature, like horns or a tail.
| 2 | Berserk | In combat, you can't take any action except attacking.
| 3 | Vulnerable | The presence of a certain substance (GM's choice) gives you -1d6 to rolls.
| 4 | Discolored | Your skin turns an unnatural shade.
| 5 | Merciful | You can't kill anyone, even angels.
| 6 | Aura | Any non-mundane you meet - including human Soldiers and sorcerers - can tell you're a demon.

## INTERVENTIONS

If at least three dice come up 1 on a single roll, it's a divine intervention; that roll fails regardless of the rest of the dice. If it would have been a success, the character gains a small advantage (which may not be immediately apparent).
If at least three dice come up 6 on a single roll, it's an infernal intervention; the roll succeeds spectacularly.

## TRIVIA

**Songs** are miracles that influence the world in certain ways. Unless the adventure specifies otherwise, PCs should not know any Songs, but antagonists might.

**Artifacts** are objects imbued with celestial power. They're like Songs with physical form. Like Songs, PCs should not usually have any artifacts to begin with, but antagonists might.

**Tethers** are ways to get between the celestial or ethereal planes and Earth. They are created by substantial events that linger in the general human consciousness, and can be disrupted or destroyed by direct celestial interference. [Atlas Obscura](http://atlasobscura.com) is a good source for potential Tethers.
