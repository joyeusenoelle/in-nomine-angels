# In Nomine: Infernal
## WORK IN PROGRESS

You're a group of demons, sent to earth in human guise to corrupt and pervert humans. The forces of Heaven aren't your only adversaries; ethereal spirits, human sorcerers, and divine Saints also vie for the souls of humanity.

## SKILLS AND ROLLS

You have two skills: Corporeal and Celestial. Use Corporeal for physical activities and to interact with humans; use Celestial for mental and spiritual activities. When you use a skill, roll as many 6-sided dice as you have points in that skill. If any dice come up 6, you succeed; otherwise you fail. Always roll at least 1 die, even if a penalty would drop you below 1 in a skill.

Roll 1d6 to determine your demonic band, or pick one from the list. Each band gains a bonus in certain situations, but their infernal nature hinders them in others. You can design your own, but each band's Corporeal and Celestial should total to 6, they should get +1d to some activity, and they should be prohibited from doing something.

|  | Choir | Corporeal | Celestial | Advantage/Disadvantage |
| --- | ----- | --------- | --------- | ---------------------- |
| 1 | Balseraph | 1 | 5 | +1d6 to convince someone you're telling the truth; can't get caught in a lie |
| 2 | Djinn | 2 | 4 | +1d6 to track someone or something; can't get attached to anything |
| 3 | Calabite | 3 | 3 | +1d6 to cause damage; can't go too long without causing damage |
| 4 | Habbalite | 3 | 3 | +1d6 to change someone's emotional state; can't let emotions sway decisions |
| 5 | Lilim | 4 | 2 | +1d6 to convince someone to do something; can't break the letter of a promise |
| 6 | Impudite | 5 | 1 | +1d6 to convince someone to do something bad; can't kill humans |

## DISSONANCE

Any time you do something your band can't do, add 1 to your Dissonance and roll 1d6. If your roll is greater than or equal to your Dissonance, you're fine for now. If it's under your Dissonance, you gain a Discord from the following table and reset your Dissonance to 0.

|  | Discord | Description |
| --- | ------- | ----------- |
| 1 | Vestigium | Your body gains an unnatural feature, like horns or a tail.
| 2 | Berserk | In combat, you must attack every round and can't take other actions.
| 3 | Vulnerable | The presence of a certain substance (GM's choice) gives you -1d6 to rolls.
| 4 | Discolored | Your skin turns an unnatural shade.
| 5 | Merciful | You can't kill anyone, even angels.
| 6 | Aura | Anyone who looks can roll Celestial to tell you're a demon.

## INTERVENTIONS

If at least three dice come up 1 on a single roll, it's a divine intervention; that roll fails regardless of the rest of the dice. If it would have been a success, the character gains a small advantage (which may not be immediately apparent).
If at least three dice come up 6 on a single roll, it's an infernal intervention; the roll succeeds spectacularly.
