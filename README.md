# In Nomine: Divine

You're a group of angels, sent to earth in human guise to help and guide humans. The forces of Hell aren't your only adversaries; ethereal spirits, human sorcerers, and the undead also vie for the souls of humanity.

## SKILLS AND ROLLS

You have two skills: Corporeal and Celestial. Use Corporeal for physical activities and to interact with humans; use Celestial for mental and spiritual activities. When you use a skill, roll as many 6-sided dice as you have points in that skill. If any dice come up 6, you succeed; otherwise you fail. Always roll at least 1 die, even if a penalty would drop you below 1 in a skill.

Roll 1d6 to determine your angelic choir, or pick one from the list. Each choir gains a bonus in certain situations, but their divine nature hinders them in others. You can design your own, but each choir's Corporeal and Celestial should total to 6, they should get +1d to some activity, and they should be prohibited from doing something.

|  | Choir | Corporeal | Celestial | Advantage/Disadvantage |
| --- | ----- | --------- | --------- | ---------------------- |
| 1 | Seraph | 1 | 5 | +1d6 to tell if someone is lying or incorrect; can't lie |
| 2 | Cherub | 2 | 4 | +1d6 if defending someone or something; can't leave a charge unprotected |
| 3 | Ofanite | 3 | 3 | +1d6 to move quickly or dodge; can't stay still too long |
| 4 | Elohite | 3 | 3 | +1d6 to evaluate situations; can't let emotions sway decisions |
| 5 | Malakite | 4 | 2 | +1d6 in combat with the wicked; can't break a promise |
| 6 | Mercurian | 5 | 1 | +1d6 to make or evaluate relationships; can't hurt humans |

## DISSONANCE

Any time you do something your choir can't do, add 1 to your Dissonance and roll 1d6. If your roll is greater than or equal to your Dissonance, you're fine for now. If it's under your Dissonance, you gain a Discord from the following table and reset your Dissonance to 0.

|  | Discord | Description |
| --- | ------- | ----------- |
| 1 | Vestigium | Your body gains an unnatural feature, like horns or a tail.
| 2 | Berserk | In combat, you must attack every round and can't take other actions.
| 3 | Vulnerable | The presence of a certain substance (GM's choice) gives you -1d6 to rolls.
| 4 | Discolored | Your skin turns an unnatural shade.
| 5 | Merciful | You can't kill anyone, even demons.
| 6 | Aura | Anyone who looks can roll Celestial to tell you're an angel.

## INTERVENTIONS

If at least three dice come up 1 on a single roll, it's a divine intervention; that roll succeeds regardless of the rest of the dice. If it would have been a success anyway, it's a spectacular success.
If at least three dice come up 6 on a single roll, it's an infernal intervention; the roll succeeds, but at a cost to the player (which may not be immediately apparent).
